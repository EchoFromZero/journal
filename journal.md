# Week 2
1. 1h Review command line, explore Github, push/commits from Command line to Github, install Anaconda
2. 1h Push/Commits to Github, explore Python, stuck by “This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has not been activated.” Stuck in this issue for a while. 
3. 1h detour from the last issue; download python 3.8.1 from the official website, Figure out the error: SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print' (I was learning from Python 2 book, but using Python 3), The statement above does not work in Python 3. In Python 3 you need to add parentheses around the value to be printed
4. 1h Ex3, I got hens “30.0”, instead of 30. I got eggs 6.75, instead of 7. (same reason, I guess) in Python 3, 7.0/4.0, 7/4 seem to be the same; Ex 4, instead “We need to put about 3 in each car.” I got “We need to put about 3.0 in each car.”     floating point number. ; Difference between double-quotes and single-quotes? Solved in Ex7.
5. 1h Ex7: I have “Cheese Burger” in two separate lines. Nor sure how to use comma in my version. Solved by the Python 3 training book; Ex8, But I don’t have access to ex9 and beyond. 
6. 1h Explore GCDI, PUG (CUNY Academic Commons), find the Python 3 hard way book; Finish Ex10 but don’t remember all the escape sequences; finish ex11.
