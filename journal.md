# Week 2
1. 1h Review command line, explore Github, push/commits from Command line to Github, install Anaconda
2. 1h Push/Commits to Github, explore Python, stuck by “This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has not been activated.” Stuck in this issue for a while. 
3. 1h detour from the last issue; download python 3.8.1 from the official website, Figure out the error: SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print' (I was learning from Python 2 book, but using Python 3), The statement above does not work in Python 3. In Python 3 you need to add parentheses around the value to be printed
4. 1h Ex3, I got hens “30.0”, instead of 30. I got eggs 6.75, instead of 7. (same reason, I guess) in Python 3, 7.0/4.0, 7/4 seem to be the same; Ex 4, instead “We need to put about 3 in each car.” I got “We need to put about 3.0 in each car.”     floating point number. ; Difference between double-quotes and single-quotes? Solved in Ex7.
5. 1h Ex7: I have “Cheese Burger” in two separate lines. Nor sure how to use comma in my version. Solved by the Python 3 training book; Ex8, But I don’t have access to ex9 and beyond. 
6. 1h Explore GCDI, PUG (CUNY Academic Commons), find the Python 3 hard way book; Finish Ex10 but don’t remember all the escape sequences; finish ex11.	
7. 1h Ex12, not sure about “If you’re on Windows try python3.6 -m pydoc input instead.”
    p.74, how to run the script with parameters on the command line.
    Ex15: Not sure how to do this: “Start python3.6 to start the python3.6 shell, and use open from the prompt just like in this program. Notice how you can open files and run read on them from within python3.6?” 
8. 1h Ex16: This is what happened when I press ControlC:
    ?Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "ex16.py", line 9, in <module>
    input("?")
    KeyboardInterrupt

    Not sure how to do Drill 3: “There’s too much repetition in this file. Use strings, formats, and escapes to print out line1,
    line2, and line3 with just one target.write() command instead of six”

# Week 1 
1. 1.5h Review the syllabus; review the command line (Git Bash), VS code. Went through Command line tutorial.
