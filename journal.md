# Week 5 (Week 3/4-3/10)
1. install Jekyll, read articles: “Why Use a Static Site Generator?”, “Creating a website with WordPress: The good and the bad”, “What is Bootstrap? – The History and the Hype,” “Brutalism: The ‘ugly’ web design trend taking over the internet”
2. Start to use Jekyll, learn more about web hosting, GitHub Pages …
Was trying to configure a subdomain, but couldn’t understand “Navigate to your DNS provider and create a CNAME record that points your subdomain to the default domain for your site. For example, if you want to use the subdomain www.example.com for your user site, create a CNAME record that points www.example.com to <user>.github.io. For more information about how to create the correct record, see your DNS provider's documentation. ”
3. Pull in the Index.html we did in-class. Push it to the new repository. Now the page can be found under the domain “echofromzero.github.io”.
4. Spend more time on HTML and CSS: HTML on W3Schools: Surprised to know these little details for accessibility! Such as “The lang Attribute,” “Alt Attribute” Go through basic HTML tutorial to The id Attribute. <button onclick="document.location = 'default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>  … How to make it a link to website? Not sure.
After I push the codes to GitHub, why does the website not change to its latest version? (It takes a few seconds to change.)


# Week 4 (Week 2/26-3/3)
1. 11:00-12:00 (1h) Make a small program to random group students into small groups!
	Got a basic model! Done! v1
2. 8:50-12:00 (3h)	In v1: I need to change manually the number of groups, the number of members. I want to make it change according to needs. Version 2 done. Can remove absent students. Do groups of students as you want. 
3. (1h) Adjusting the version 2; testing with another roster. 
4. Reading  (2h): Read *A Web for Everyone: Chapters 1 and 2 How People with Disabilities Use the Web: Tools and Techniques (W3C)*; *Dear Developer, The Web Isn't About You*; *Two Bit History: The World Wide Web and Its Inventor*


# Week 3
1. 0.5h Get journal/goals into shape, push them to Github
2. 2.5h Learn Python 3 the hard way: 
    Fix ex16.py drill 3
    Finish ex16-22
3. 0.5h Ex23 is relatively difficult to understand. Got stuck in this. 
    Skip from Ex23 to Ex 28
4. 2.5h Finish ex29-38  review and learn: if, elif, else, loops, lists
    Ex35, a little complicated. 
    Ex37 symbol review pp.162-165
    Ex38, not sure about the last two lines


# Week 2
1. 1h Review command line, explore Github, push/commits from Command line to Github, install Anaconda
2. 1h Push/Commits to Github, explore Python, stuck by “This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has not been activated.” Stuck in this issue for a while. 
3. 1h detour from the last issue; download python 3.8.1 from the official website, Figure out the error: SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print' (I was learning from Python 2 book, but using Python 3), The statement above does not work in Python 3. In Python 3 you need to add parentheses around the value to be printed
4. 1h Ex3, I got hens “30.0”, instead of 30. I got eggs 6.75, instead of 7. (same reason, I guess) in Python 3, 7.0/4.0, 7/4 seem to be the same; Ex 4, instead “We need to put about 3 in each car.” I got “We need to put about 3.0 in each car.”     floating point number. ; Difference between double-quotes and single-quotes? Solved in Ex7.
5. 1h Ex7: I have “Cheese Burger” in two separate lines. Nor sure how to use comma in my version. Solved by the Python 3 training book; Ex8, But I don’t have access to ex9 and beyond. 
6. 1h Explore GCDI, PUG (CUNY Academic Commons), find the Python 3 hard way book; Finish Ex10 but don’t remember all the escape sequences; finish ex11.	
7. 1h Ex12, not sure about “If you’re on Windows try python3.6 -m pydoc input instead.”
    p.74, how to run the script with parameters on the command line.
    Ex15: Not sure how to do this: “Start python3.6 to start the python3.6 shell, and use open from the prompt just like in this program. Notice how you can open files and run read on them from within python3.6?” 
8. 1h Ex16: This is what happened when I press ControlC:
    ?Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "ex16.py", line 9, in <module>
    input("?")
    KeyboardInterrupt

    Not sure how to do Drill 3: “There’s too much repetition in this file. Use strings, formats, and escapes to print out line1,
    line2, and line3 with just one target.write() command instead of six”

# Week 1 
1. 1.5h Review the syllabus; review the command line (Git Bash), VS code. Went through Command line tutorial. 
2. 4.5h Review command line. Go into more details about Grep command. Finish all the readings
